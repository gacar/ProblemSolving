Mark and Jane are very happy after having their first child. Their son loves toys, so Mark wants to buy some. 
There are a number of different toys lying in front of him, tagged with their prices. 
Mark has only a certain amount to spend, and he wants to maximize the number of toys he buys with this money. 
Given a list of toy prices and an amount to spend, determine the maximum number of gifts he can buy.
Note Each toy can be purchased only once.

     * Complete the 'maximumToys' function below.
     *
     * The function is expected to return an INTEGER.
     * The function accepts following parameters:
     *  1. INTEGER_ARRAY prices
     *  2. INTEGER k
     */

    public static int maximumToys(List<Integer> prices, int k) {
        Collections.sort(prices);
        int totalP = 0;
        int result = 0;
    for(Integer price : prices){
        if(k >  totalP + price){
            totalP = totalP + price;
            result++;
        }else
        return result;       
       }
       return 0;
    }
